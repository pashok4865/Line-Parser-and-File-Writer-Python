# Line-Parser-and-File-Writer-Python
The "Line Parser and File Writer" project is a Python script designed to parse lines from a file and extract specific values based on a custom format. The script takes user input for the file number, paragraph number, and line number, and then retrieves the corresponding line from the file. It applies a parsing function to extract the file name, paragraph number, line number, and a value from each line. The extracted values are then written to an output file named "program.py". The script continues this process until it encounters a termination condition (fname = '0', parno = 0, lineno = 0). Finally, the contents of the "program.py" file are displayed to the user.

Example output is displayed in the program.py file when the user inputs the numbers 2, 3, and 3.
